# Currently known issues and workarounds

## Almer Companion:
* When entering a wrong password while trying to connect a device to WiFi, the device gets disconnected from the Companion and the wrong password gets remembered, which locks you out of entering the right password.

    **Workaround**: Connect to your device again and long press the WiFi for which you entered the wrong password and select Forget. This allows you to enter a password again for that WiFi.
* When connecting to a pair of headphones via Bluetooth, you cannot disconnect from them without turning them off as they don't show up in the headphones screen and we don't have a disconnect feature implemented.
* All headphones previously paired with a device immediately try to reconnect when they get turned on, this way we can reach a state in which the device is connected to multiple headphones. To unpair a set of bluetooth headset use the unpair button of the headset.
* When changing the name of glasses from Companion, other Companion apps have issue with updating the name if they are already displaying the old one (it flickers between the old one and the new one)

    **Workaround:** Closing and reopening the Companion app solves this.

### General fix
* Close the Almer Companion App
* Restart the glasses
